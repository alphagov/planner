        <p>If you work under contract, you usually have the legal right to a year of maternity leave. This is time off work to look after your new baby. </p>
        <p>It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been in your job, what you’re paid or the hours you work. </p>
        <p>To get maternity leave, you must tell your employer that you’re pregnant by a set time. There are also rules about when you can start your maternity leave. </p>
        <p>Maternity leave is split into 2 parts: Ordinary Maternity Leave and Additional Maternity Leave. </p>
